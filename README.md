# Non-free examples for Vc

This repository contains examples that cannot be distributed with the rest of Vc.
If you want to compile the examples, place the clone into the examples directory of Vc:
```sh
cd Vc/examples
git clone https://github.com/VcDevel/Vc-examples-nonfree nonfree
```
Now, if building examples is enabled, the Vc buildsystem will pick up the additional examples on the next run of cmake.
